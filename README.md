# Doctor Robo Patient/Kiosk Application v1.0.2

This is an Android Application - Doctor Robo Patient/Kiosk Application - I developed for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon for Connected Smart Cities from 2nd October to 3rd October 2017.

This application utilizes android phones to serve as a screen for patients to interact with at a kiosk, or from the convenience of their mobile phone to converse with a doctor anywhere in the world. It also has the ability to add funds to user account and check if there are any medication ready for collection at a nearby kiosk.

This project is unique because it utilizes the Amazon IoT Button and SNS services to process information and call the ambulance with a touch of a button.

This has been deployed on the Amazon Cloud so it can be accessed from anywhere, anytime.

This project is built in 2 days from 2nd OCT 2017 to 3rd OCT 2017 for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon, It comes with 4 other applications (Doctor, Patient, Ambulance, Kiosk) as well as numerous IoT sensors and motors to power the entire system.
